# FirstProgramCS
This is my first program in c#, it's a game where you need to fill the playing field with O. 
All the feedback are welcome because I want to improve devlopment skils in C#.
Yes, all the comments are in french, because I speak french and because this project was only for my professor,
but i published it because ÃŽ want to know if i did it good or bad.
The first thing that you may ask is : " Why there is so much comments ? ".
Well, its because my professor ( again ) want to know exactly what is happening and why.
And also there is a grade for this, so voila i guess.
I am devlopping in C# for 6 week now, i really like to do this.
Thanks for reading and giving feedback :)
